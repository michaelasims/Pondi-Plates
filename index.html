      <p2>We arive to planet Pondi... After only a few weeks on Pondi, we come across our first encounter with the Pondi People. They robbed us of our food, leaving only 2 bottles of water and a freeze dried ice cream. We were then left on a desolate planet with no food. After discussion, our team of colonizers decided our only option was to capture these aliens and use them as game. We then designed a complex trapping system to prevent these little theifs from stealing more of our food supply. We then captured a Pondi. We quickly discovered the game was mad of a tough, hard to eat meat, that didn't digest well with humans. So, we created Pondi Plates, a recipe book using spices and extraterestrial minerals and ingredients from Planet Pondi.  </p2>
